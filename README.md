# Introduction to React Router DOM - Beginner's Guide

## Description
Welcome to the beginner's guide to React Router DOM! This project is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to the powerful routing library used in React applications. React Router DOM enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications with seamless navigation. 

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to introduce beginners to the basics of routing in React applications using React Router DOM. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to implement basic routing, nested routes, route parameters, and navigation in a React application.

## Features
- **Basic Routing**: Learn how to set up simple routes to navigate between different components.
- **Nested Routing**: Understand how to create nested routes for more complex application structures.
- **Route Parameters**: Explore dynamic routing by using route parameters.
- **Programmatic Navigation**: Discover how to navigate between routes programmatically.
- **404 Error Page**: Implement a catch-all route for handling 404 errors.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UniversityOfEmergingTechnology/routing-in-react.git
cd react-router-dom-introduction
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage
After starting the application, navigate through the different routes to see how React Router DOM manages the views. Experiment by adding new routes and modifying existing ones to better understand routing concepts.
